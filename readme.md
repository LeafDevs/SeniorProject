# Senior Project

Hello this is my senior project for school. This is an original project of mine for a minecraft server.

This project is something i wanted to make for fun. Its a core for a server that wants to be turn based like baldur's gate 3/DnD along with a wynncraft twist.

this will most likely be finished in 2025 or late 2024.

This is an open source project and if you decide to fork this for earlier versions of minecraft such as 1.8.9 or 1.12.2 or what ever version. Please provide me credit for original source aswell as linking this repo in the readme.md file.

This was coded for the minecraft version 1.20.2

Thanks
